# KL GUI

A graphical user interface to show how the KL divergence between two gaussians
varies with standard deviation and mean. The goal is to help people gain an
intuition for what the KL divergence means in the context of
this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13263) on the posterior bias introduced by using emulators in 
inference pipelines.
